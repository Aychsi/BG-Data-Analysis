Not as urgent.   i wouldn't like this. you get that one little loud burst and then everything else goes down. it only gives you that one blast in the beginning. I would want something a little more - a little more loud sound. Yes it can fade, but a little more loud sound in the beginning.    \n",

       "1   It would definitely get my attention.   High alert wouldn't be so attention grabbing. I have my high alert setting lower than the average person. I have my high alert between 160 or 170. It's not super urgent, but I want them to grab my attention but I don't want anyone to think I'm dying.    \n",

If that makes sense. It's not as annoying, it's more subtle. Highs aren't as much of an emergency as a low is.   \n",
