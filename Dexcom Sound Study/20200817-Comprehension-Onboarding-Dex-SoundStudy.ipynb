       "   [If HoH]   I have noted here that you have been diagnosed with a hearing impairment. Can you talk to me a bit about when you were diagnosed with a hearing impairment? How does this affect your day-to-day? Do you use any hearing assistive technology, like hearing aids or a cochlear implant?  [If yes] Are there any times when you turn off your hearing assistive technology?  \\\n",
